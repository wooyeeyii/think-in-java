/**
 * 192. Word Frequency
 * <p>
 * Write a bash script to calculate the frequency of each word in a text file words.txt.
 * <p>
 * For simplicity sake, you may assume:
 * words.txt contains only lowercase characters and space ' ' characters.
 * Each word must consist of lowercase characters only.
 * Words are separated by one or more whitespace characters.
 * <p>
 * Example:
 * Assume that words.txt has the following content:
 * the day is sunny the the
 * the sunny is is
 * Your script should output the following, sorted by descending frequency:
 * the 4
 * is 3
 * sunny 2
 * day 1
 * <p>
 * Note:
 * Don't worry about handling ties, it is guaranteed that each word's frequency count is unique.
 * Could you write it in one-line using Unix pipes?
