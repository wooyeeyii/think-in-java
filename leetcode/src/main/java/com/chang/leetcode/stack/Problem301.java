     * Key Points:
     * Generate unique answer once and only once, do not rely on Set.
     * Do not need preprocess.
     *
     * Explanation:
     * We all know how to check a string of parentheses is valid using a stack. Or even simpler use a counter.
     * The counter will increase when it is ‘(‘ and decrease when it is ‘)’. Whenever the counter is negative,
     * we have more ‘)’ than ‘(‘ in the prefix.
     *
     * To make the prefix valid, we need to remove a ‘)’. The problem is: which one? The answer is any one in the prefix.
     * However, if we remove any one, we will generate duplicate results, for example: s = ()), we can remove s[1] or s[2]
     * but the result is the same (). Thus, we restrict ourself to remove the first ) in a series of concecutive )s.
     *
     * After the removal, the prefix is then valid. We then call the function recursively to solve the rest of the string.
     * However, we need to keep another information: the last removal position. If we do not have this position,
     * we will generate duplicate by removing two ‘)’ in two steps only with a different order.
     * For this, we keep tracking the last removal position and only remove ‘)’ after that.
     *
     * Now one may ask. What about ‘(‘? What if s = ‘(()(()’ in which we need remove ‘(‘?
     * The answer is: do the same from right to left.
     * However a cleverer idea is: reverse the string and reuse the code!
     * Here is the final implement in Java.
